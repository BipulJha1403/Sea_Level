# Effect of rising sea level

### The work done in this project analyses the effect that the overall sea level has on the different countries. For a detailed overview take a look into the "sea_level_coastal_area.md" file!!

### The basic work flow is discussed below

## **3. Work Flow**

a. An **Exploratory Analysis** on the provided dataset was done.  
b. The main aim of the Analysis was to **understand the effects of rising sea level on the land masses**.  
c. We import the 2 datasets and do a bit of **pre processing**  
d. The first plot shows the **globally rising sea level**.  
e. We then looked at the **total area of land masses in each country**. The countries were splitted into 2 sections **because plotting all the countries in one data set would have made the plot very clumsy!!**  
f. We made **5 different plots** for **Sub Saharan Africa** countries and the **area that will be submerged** if the **sea level rises by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 meters**  
g. We made **5 different plots** for **non - Sub Saharan Africa** countries and the **area that will be submerged** if the **sea level rises by 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 meters**
